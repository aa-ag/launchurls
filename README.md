# Launch URLs

Python script to launch multiple URL's all at once from an excel file. 

`script.py` will use Github's API to grab all URL's (repos) from a user's account and save them into a CSV or other type of file. Then, it will launch them through the browser all at the same time. 

#### TO DO

- Write columns instead of rows.
- Write function to launch all of them at the same time.
