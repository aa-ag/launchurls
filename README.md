# Launch URLs

Python script to launch multiple URL's all at once from an CSV/excel file. 

`script.py` uses Github's API to grab all URL's (repos) from a user's account and save them into a CSV, alphabetically.

Optionally, urls can be shortened using Bitly's API.

Then, the script launches them through the browser all at the same time.
